# W.A.R.P. Lang
Implementing LISP-like language on top of ruby with the end goal of using Rubinius VM

Primary language syntax and sematics is inspired by Erlang, Clojure, Lua, Shen, Haskell, Scheme

##Features

- Will be immutable impure functional language for Ruby platform
- One time assignments (with bind expression)
- Local assignments (with let macro)
- Extensible macros support (Future)
- Adding tables and export / import statements
- Pattern Matching (Future)
- Concurrency constructs (Future)
- Expressive dynamic type system
- More datatypes (Bignum, Rational, Vectors, Hashmaps)
